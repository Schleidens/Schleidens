  ## About me &#128513;
  <p>
  <b>
  I am Schleidens a lover of technology &#128525; passionate about front end development, I master and I work on my projects with Vue/Nuxt a front framework that I really like.
  I also work with reactjs and try to have a minimum XP with other front frameworks like Svelte.
I also do mobile development with flutter, Ionic (especially with ionic-vue), I have backend knowledge with ruby on rails and node js (woohh fullstack JS&#128526;).
  i like to learn new technology and update myself. i also like to contribute in open source projects

  >PS: I don't really like to say that I'm a fullstack developer because I really like working with data but I don't like managing it too much (lmaooo&#128517;).

  working with you is already a pleasure for me &#128519;
